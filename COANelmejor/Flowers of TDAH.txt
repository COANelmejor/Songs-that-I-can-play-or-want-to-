Verse 1:
We were good, we were strong
Thought I'd be where I belong
Working hard every day
Trying to find a better way

Mm, you don't know what I go through
Don't know what it's like
Started to cry but then remembered I

Chorus:
I can give myself some praise
Value what I bring each day
Try to accept who I am
But you make it hard to stay

I can strive and push myself
But your heart eludes me still
And I can love me better than you can

Bridge:
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby

Verse 2:
Buy you gifts, try to please
But nothing seems to release
The grip you have on my heart
It's tearing me apart

Ooh, you don't know what it's like, baby
To have all in my mind
Started to cry but then remembered I

Chorus:
I can give myself some praise
Value what I bring each day
Try to accept who I am
But you make it hard to stay

I can strive and push myself
But your heart eludes me still
And I can love me better than you can

Bridge:
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better

Brigde:
Mm, you don't know what I go through
Don't know what it's like
Started to cry but then remembered I

Chorus:
I can give myself credit (oh)
Appreciate what I do (mmh)
Try to love me for who I am (yeah)
But it's hard when I'm with you (never will)

I can strive and push myself
But it seems I can't win your heart
And I can love me better than you can

Bridge:
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
I can love me better, baby
Can love me better
